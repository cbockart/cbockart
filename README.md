- 😄😄🏻‍ Transfer student attending Iowa State Univerisity, currently a sophomore

- 📝 I am going to try and post as much material as I can on here whether it is notes I take from class or small projects I am developing on my own, I hope some of the material will help you all
- Fun fact: I have severe dyslexia so I'm sorry if any b,p,d,q, or g's are mixed up in the code I post (smae goes

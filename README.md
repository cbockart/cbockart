### Hi there, I'm Callie Bockart :v:

**Thanks for visiting my page!**


- 😄Currently a junior at Iowa State, I am on track to complete the Software Engineering degree by 2024.         


         
- The newest things I am learning this semester is computer architecture, and advance app developement.
  I am most excited for learning assembly and machine langauge (VHDL MIPS) this school year.
  
- I began my coding jounrey back in 2020, and the most important thing I have learned 
  is that it's never too late to try and learn soemthing new, just because it doesn't 
  come quickly doesn't mean it won't come at all.
  
- 📝 I am going to try and post as much material as I can on here whether it is notes I take from 
  class or small projects I am developing on my own, I hope some of the material will help you all

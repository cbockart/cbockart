<Begin self-description>
- ðŸ˜„ Recent graduate from Iowa State, I completed a degree in Software Engineering in May 2024.   
- Please visit the website I created to see some on my work! 
         At https://www.colorworksgroup.com/
         


         
- Most recently I was completing freelance work for a small female owned copmany called ColorWorks. I designed and developed a wesbite
  learning new skills in frontend, backend, and UX/UI design. I also created an app for that company however it has
  not fully launched yet, althought I am uploading the code and a video showcasing the user freindly design.
  
- I began my coding journey in 2020, and the most important thing I have learned 
  is that it's never too late to try and learn soemthing new, just because it doesn't 
  come quickly doesn't mean it won't come at all.
  
- I am going to try and post as much material as I can on here whether it is notes I take from 
  class or small projects I am developing on my own, I hope some of the material will help you all
